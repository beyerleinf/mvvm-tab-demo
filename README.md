> Simple MVVM Tab Demo using C# WPF.

> Inspired by [this SO Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53521141/how-to-get-rid-of-bindingexceptions-when-switching-between-to-views-in-a-tabcon)

This repo is using .Net Framework 4.6.1.

This Demo should demonstrate how to use the `TabControl` of WPF when using the MVVM concept. It's also using a SharedViewModel if you should need something like this.
